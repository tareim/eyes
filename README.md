Project Title:eyes
Description of Project This was an exercise to make eyes move with the cursor. We started with one static eye and then added code to make two eyes and then make them move with the cursor. When both were able to be moved by the cursor, we knew we had finished. It might be nice to be able to move them around the screen in future.
